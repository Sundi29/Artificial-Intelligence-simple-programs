Basic Programs on Machine Learning

This is a Python program which takes the input data set examples, and
gets the co-effecient using regression and matrices. Hence it can
predict future result for inputs. We also show the "goodness of fit"
which is given by R square and any value of R square close to 1 (less than 0) is
considered good.
